Instant React/Redux Boilerplate

Setting up React and Redux can take a few moments and be a pain. This repository is the simplest React example application that adheres to the container/component react paradigm.

Jest and SASS are configured using Babel.

With regards to Redux I've instantiated a single reducer, very simple store and two action dispatchers; one synchronous action and one asynchronous using Thunk middleware.

I hope this gets you up to speed with regards to your react/redux applications faster.
